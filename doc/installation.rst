In DEBUG mode (Default mode)
____________________________

 * Django Debug Toolbar::

   Download at https://github.com/django-debug-toolbar/django-debug-toolbar

Quick Start
-----------

Then launch the following commands::

  python manage.py syncdb --migrate
  python manage.py collectstatic
  python manage.py runserver

You should see the following output::

  Validating models...
  0 errors found

  Django version 1.2, using settings 'authentic.settings'
  Development server is running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
  Quit the server with CONTROL-C.

  You can access the running application on http://127.0.0.1:8000/


Specifying a different database
-------------------------------

This is done by modifying the DATABASES dictionary in your local_settings.py
file (create it in Authentic project directory); for example::

 DATABASES['default'] = {
   'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
   'NAME': 'authentic',
   'USER': 'admindb',
   'PASSWORD': 'foobar',
   'HOST': 'db.example.com',
   'PORT': '', # empty string means default value
 }

You should refer to the Django documentation on databases settings at
http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#databases for all
the details.

How to upgrade to a new version of authentic ?
----------------------------------------------

Authentic store all its data in a relational database as specified in its
settings.py or local_settings.py file. So in order to upgrade to a new version
of authentic you have to update your database schema using the
migration command â€” you will need to have installed the dependency
django-south, see the beginning of this README file.::

  python ./manage.py migrate

Then you will need to create new tables if there are.::

  python ./manage.py syncdb

DEBUG Mode by default, static files and the Django debug toolbar dependency ?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

By default, Authentic 2 is in the DEBUG mode. As a matter of fact, static
files are only served by the Django development server when the project is
run in the DEBUG mode.

Then, we made this temporary choice (DEBUG mode by default) because most
of the users will begin with Authentic 2 using the Django development server
and we want to avoid that people have a bad first impression because static
files would not be served.

In production, the Django development server should not be used and a
dedicated server should be used to serve the static files.

In the DEBUG mode, the Django Debug Toolbar is used. Then, by default,
Authentic 2 is also dependant of this module. Find more information on
https://github.com/django-debug-toolbar/django-debug-toolbar#readme.
