How to upgrade to a new version of authentic ?
----------------------------------------------

Authentic stores all its data in a relational database as specified in its
settings.py or local_settings.py file. So in order to upgrade to a new version
of authentic you have to update your database schema using the
migration command â€” you will need to have installed the dependency
django-south, see the beginning of this README file.::

  python ./manage.py migrate

Then you will need to create new tables if there are.::

  python ./manage.py syncdb
