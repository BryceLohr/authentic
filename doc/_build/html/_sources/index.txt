Authentic2's documentation
==========================

Authentic2 is a versatile identity provider addressing a broad
range of needs, from simple to advanced setups, around web authentication,
attribute sharing, namespace mapping and authorization management.

Authentic2 supports many protocols and standards, including SAML2, CAS, OpenID,
LDAP, X509, OATH, and can bridge between them.

Authentic2 is under the GNU AGPL version 3 licence.

It has support for SAMLv2 thanks to `Lasso <http://lasso.entrouvert.org>`_,
a free (GNU GPL) implementation of the Liberty Alliance and OASIS
specifications of SAML2, ID-FF1.2 and ID-WSF2.
